# Actuarial risk analysis and financial modeling

The insurance industry depends on risk analysis and financial modeling by actuaries. The professionals in that business need to create what-if scenarios for long term policies, and for daily market investments. On top of that, regulations such as the International Financial Reporting Standard 17 (IFRS 17) add to their burden in the form of reports. If you are used to using grid computing, you can easily adapt to the world of virtual compute on Azure. Instead of buying more hardware, you'll spend your money on operations (not capital that begins to depreciate immediately).

The key to using Azure compute is to prepare your data and develop a way to parallelize the work. The other aspects of using Azure compute comes from understanding how technologies such as Azure Batch or Data Factory can be used to process the work. Finally, the guide surveys options for reporting--such as using a Data Science VM, or Power BI.
